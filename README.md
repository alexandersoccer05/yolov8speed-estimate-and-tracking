# yolov8speed-estimate-and-tracking






For this project I wanted to push myself and learn about Python so I used Yolo v8. I used opencv and especially ultralytics. This project was fun and gave me a new understanding of the possibilities of computer vision and the endless amount of real-world applications it can be used for. I initially wanted to make it so that when the program detected not only the speed of the car but also when an accident occurs. For example, if the car dramatically slow down or stop indicating it was hit by another car. I also wanted to try looking at different audio cues to highlight when an accident occurs. I was then having ideas for the future like making alerts of when crashes happen directly to a device with the clip of an accident and the option to send help (911). I did not have time for all this so I mainly just focused on finding speed and detecting the cars using yolo. This allowed me to ultimately make this program.



To run this program you will need to simply download Python (3.11 was used) and the correct interpreters highlighted in coco.txt. To find the speed run the speed python file and to find the main object detection run the main python file. This program does take some cpu/gpu proficient computers as yolo is already set to the lowest setting

You can also use different videos just change the cap. You can even do live videos as it does the work in real-time.
